## 📌 Problem Statement

> Tier-2 users struggle with booking lab tests due to medical jargon, poor UX, and lack of trust in pre-paid services.

Despite the growth of platforms like 1mg and Practo, lab test UX in India remains urban-centric. This product aims to simplify test discovery and booking for Tier-2 cities by localizing experience and reducing friction.
